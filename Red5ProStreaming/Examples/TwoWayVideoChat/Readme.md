#Two Way Video Chat

This example demonstrates two way communication using Red5 Pro.  It also demonstrates using Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) on the server.

###Example Code
- ***[TwoWayVideoChatExample.m](TwoWayVideoChatExample.m)***

- ***[BaseExample.m](
https://github.com/red5pro/streaming-ios/blob/master/Red5ProStreaming/BaseExample.m)***

###Setup
Two way communication simply requires setting up a publish stream and a subscribe stream at the same time.  You can test the example with two devices.  On the second device select the **Swap Names** toggle on the main screen before launching. 

Once the streams have populated the table you can choose the other device by its name.

###Getting Live Streams
You can make RPC calls to the server using `R5Connection.call`.  The call is similar to `R5Stream.send` but allows you to specify a return method name.

`streams.getLiveStreams` is a built in RPC in all Red5 Pro servers.  This call will return a string value that contains a json array of all streams that are currently publishing.

```Objective-C
    //call out to get our new stream
    [self.publish.connection call:@"streams.getLiveStreams" withReturn:@"onGetLiveStreams"  withParam:nil];
```

The return method will be called on the `R5Stream.client`.  The client will need a method that matches the signature of the return.  Since `streams.getLiveStreams` returns a string, a void method with a single string parameter will handle the result.

```Objective-C
-(void)onGetLiveStreams:(NSString *)streams{
    
    NSError *e = nil;
  
    self.streams = [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData: [streams dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding] options: NSJSONReadingMutableContainers error: &e];
    
    //set this as our table data source
    
    [self.tableView reloadData];

    if(self.subscribe == nil){
        
        self.timer = [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:2 target:self selector:@selector(getStreams:) userInfo:nil repeats:NO];
    }
    

}
```
A simple json parsing will get all streams, and start the timer over to request the streams again.  The table view is loaded with the new stream names on the return to display for subscription.


###Detecting Video Loss
A common feature of two way video chat is handling when video does not have enough bandwidth to broadcast properly.  This example displays a profile icon over the subscription stream when this is detected.  You can force this to happen by setting **showVideo** to NO in connection.plist on your other device.

In order to detect if video is currently being streamed, the `R5Stream.client` can implement `-(void)onR5PublishStateNotification:(NSString*)value;`
This method returns a mapped value of properties related to the publishing stream - and is called by the remote publisher on a fixed interval.

One of the keys in the state notification is `streamingMode`.  This example shows that if **"Video"** is not found in the streamMode, display the profile icon until it is broadcasting video again.

```Objective-C
-(void)onR5PublishStateNotification:(NSString*)value{
   
    NSArray *pairs = [value componentsSeparatedByString:@";"];
   
    for(int i=0;i<pairs.count;i++){
       
        NSArray *keyvalue = [[pairs objectAtIndex:i] componentsSeparatedByString:@"="];
        
        if(keyvalue.count > 1){

            NSString *key = [keyvalue objectAtIndex:0];
            NSString *val = [keyvalue objectAtIndex:1];
            
            //show or hide profile overlay if "streamingMode" contains "Video"
            if([key isEqualToString:@"streamingMode"]){
               
                if([val rangeOfString:@"Video"].location == NSNotFound){
                    
                    self.profileView.hidden = NO;
                    [self.subscribeR5View.view bringSubviewToFront:self.profileView];
                    
                }else{
                    
                    self.profileView.hidden = YES;
                }
            }
            
        }
    }
    
}
```
